# CAD Design Repository

This repository contains CAD design files and projects that are specifically designed for use with Fusion 360 and OnShape. Here's a breakdown of the different sections of this README file:

## Getting Started

To get started with the CAD design files and projects in this repository, you'll need either Fusion 360 or OnShape installed on your computer. Both of these software options are free to use for personal or educational purposes.

### Fusion 360

Fusion 360 is a cloud-based CAD/CAM/CAE software for product design and manufacturing. It offers a wide range of tools for 3D modeling, simulation, and collaboration. You can download Fusion 360 from the [Autodesk website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

### OnShape

OnShape is a cloud-based CAD software that offers similar functionality to Fusion 360, but with a focus on collaboration and sharing. It's designed for use by teams that need to work together on CAD projects. You can sign up for a free account on the [OnShape website](https://www.onshape.com/).

Once you have Fusion 360 or OnShape installed, you can download the files in this repository and start working with them.

## Contents

This repository contains the following directories:

- `projects`: This directory contains completed CAD design projects that you can use for inspiration or reference.

- `parts`: This directory contains CAD models of individual parts that you can use in your own projects.

- `templates`: This directory contains CAD design templates that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.

- `tutorials`: This directory contains tutorials that can help you learn how to use Fusion 360 or OnShape and complete specific tasks.

## Contributing
